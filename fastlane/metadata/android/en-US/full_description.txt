Offline speech to text tranlator based on Seamless M4T

As a standalone app Seamless can translate between English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, and Russian.

Upon launching Seamless for the first time, the app will download the necessary model from Hugging Face.
Please note that this is the only instance where internet permission is required.
Once the model is downloaded, speech to text translation works entirely offline, ensuring your privacy and convenience.

To get the most out of Seamless, follow these simple tips:

- Press and hold the microphone button while speaking.
- Pause briefly before starting to speak.
- Speak clearly, loudly, and at a moderate pace.
- Then select the target language
