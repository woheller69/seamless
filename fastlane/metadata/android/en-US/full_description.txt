Offline speech to text tranlator based on Seemless M4T

As a standalone app Seemless can translate between English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, and Russian.

Upon launching Seemless for the first time, the app will download the necessary model from Hugging Face.
Please note that this is the only instance where internet permission is required.
Once the model is downloaded, speech to text translation works entirely offline, ensuring your privacy and convenience.

To get the most out of Seemless, follow these simple tips:

- Press and hold the microphone button while speaking.
- Pause briefly before starting to speak.
- Speak clearly, loudly, and at a moderate pace.
- Then select the target language
